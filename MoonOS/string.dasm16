; ----- strncpy
; Copies null-terminated string at I to J, or the first A elements of it if the string is longer.
; Strings are assumed to be terminated with an entire 0 word.
; I and J are advanced to the ends of the respective strings.
; Note if the string is longer than A elements, the result is not null terminated.

; ----- strcmp
; Compares null-terminated strings I and J. Returns 0 in A if they match, a signed value suitable for ordering otherwise
; Strings are assumed to be terminated with an entire 0 word, and either both packed or neither packed.
; I and J are advanced to terminating word, or first word that differs.

; ----- strcmp_ia
; Compares null-terminated strings I and A. Returns 0 in A if they match, a signed value suitable for ordering otherwise
; I is assumed to be one word per character; A is treated as a packed string.
; I is advanced to terminating null, or first character that differs.
