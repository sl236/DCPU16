--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please to be enclosing three copies with each 
full shipment of peaceful research supplies.
Pack carefully. Content sensitive to vibration.

To the receipients

Please find enclosed latest equipment for to increase
your research capability. It is hoped that the expanded
capacity will enable your peaceful research stations
to track more potential friends faster and target gifts
tovards them more effectively. It may also be repurposed
in the event any come visit; it is no good research 
station that survives a friendship party.

DCPU-16 Hardware Info:
        Name: M1537 "SHINING STAR" MEMORY BANK
        ID: 0x00001537
        Version: 0x0001
        Manufacturer: 0xDEAD5345

Description:
        The M1537 "SHINING STAR" provides an additional 64kb 
        memory for those of you that have borrowed DCPU16 technology 
        on your stations. In addition it is DMA bus master and 
        welcome party host.

Interrupt behaviour:
        Upon being surprised by HWI, the M1537 examines the zeroth register
        of the borrowed technology and acts upon the contents as follows:
        
        0x00: Set message
           The oneth register is snooped upon. If it is nonzero, subsequent
        operations will trigger an interrupt within the connected friendly 
        technology, sending this same message back, until the next Set message
        interrupt is received. Otherwise, no messages will be sent upon
        operation completion.
        
        0x01: Drain self
           The oneth register is snooped upon to discover the number of
        words that are to be drained. The twoth register yields the start
        of the source inside "SHINING STAR", the threeth yields the destination
        inside the friendly technology. The contents is moved forthwith. 
        
        0x02: Drain other
          The registers are examined as for Drain self, however the direction
        of motion is reversed. 
        
        0x03: Provide gift
          The "SHINING STAR" memory bank comprises 16 physical chips
        storing one bitplane each. Oxygenated carbohydrate is carefully packed
        beneath these. The oneth register is read, current is passed through
        the carbohydrate for each chip corresponding to a set bit in the oneth
        register to enable these to be gifted at high velocity to a passing 
        friend. Once gifted the chips can no longer be used to store data and
        those bits are undefined in future Drain operations.
        
        0x04: Party surprise
          The "SHINING STAR" memory bank activates its Special Party Surprise.
        This may only be done once. The polite host stays well back and permits
        friends to view the surprise at close range for best effect. There may
        be some physical effect to nearby friendly borrowed technology.

Additional Notes:    
        Receiving any other message may cause parts of the Shining Star 
        to ignite. Moontech cannot guarantee proper operation thereafter.
        
        The Drain operations take one clock per eight words and a minimum of two
        clocks. Memory access is bus borrowing and so connected friendly 
        technology will also take one clock longer per memory access it 
        performs than usual while these operations are ongoing.
