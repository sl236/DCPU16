This is a JavaScript [DCPU16](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt) emulator implementation.  

It implements the [v1.7 spec](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Q4JvQvnM), and the following devices:
* [LEM 1802](http://dcpu.com/highnerd/rc_1/lem1802.txt) monitor
* [Generic keyboard](http://dcpu.com/highnerd/rc_1/keyboard.txt)
* [Generic clock](http://dcpu.com/highnerd/rc_1/clock.txt)
* [HMD2043 floppy drive](https://gist.github.com/2495578) (not Notch's, but he said he'll use that spec verbatim or nearly so).
* [a non-standard in-circuit debugger](http://www.toothycat.net/~sham/dcpu16/debugger.txt)

The emulator may be used online here: http://www.toothycat.net/~sham/dcpu16  
A MoonOS build is also available online: http://www.toothycat.net/~sham/dcpu16/index.html?shell=asm%20kernel.dasm16  

The version of the emulator and MoonOS on the site may lag behind GitHub by as much as a day.
