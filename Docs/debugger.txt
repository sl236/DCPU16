Interrupts do different things depending on contents of the A register:

 A | BEHAVIOR
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0 | The B register is read, and the corresponding memory address is protected.
 1 | The B register is read, and the corresponding memory address is unprotected.
 2 | The B register is copied to the hardware breakpoint register
 3 | The hardware breakpoint register is copied to the B register
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever PC is equal to the hardware breakpoint register, 
or an attempt is made by the DCPU or any peripheral 
to write to a protected memory address, DCPU execution 
is immediately halted. DCPU state may then be examined and execution
resumed by external mechanisms not covered by this spec.
